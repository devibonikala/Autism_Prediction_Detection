# 🧠 Autism Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual is likely to have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on their responses to a screening questionnaire and other relevant attributes.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: To predict autism using features like age, gender, ATEC score, and behavioral attributes.
- **Type**: Binary Classification (Yes / No for autism prediction)
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains responses to 10 questions and additional demographic data. Some features include:

- A1 to A10 (screening responses)
- Age
- Gender
- Jaundice (Yes/No)
- Family history of ASD
- Who is completing the test
- Result (Autism = 1 / No Autism = 0)
